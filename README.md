# Fluree Client SDK for TypeScript/JavaScript

This is the official Fluree client SDK for TypeScript/JavaScript. It is a wrapper around the Fluree API, providing a more convenient way to interact with Fluree v3 databases.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @fluree/fluree-client
```

## Usage

To use the Fluree client SDK, you need to import the `FlureeClient` class from the package and create a new instance of it. You can then use the instance to interact with a Fluree database.

```typescript
import { FlureeClient } from '@fluree/fluree-client';
```
